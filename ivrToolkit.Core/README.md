A toolkit for writing Interactive Voice Response Applications. 
- It requires an ivrToolkit.Plugin of your choice. I recommend ivrToolkit.Plugin.SipSorcery
- Also has plugins for Dialogic Sip and Analog but requires Dialogic drivers
See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/ivrToolkit/ivrToolkit/releases) for detailed version history.
